# Automobile-Price-Prediction

Business Case:-To Create a predictive model by applying some data science techniques for the price of cars with the available independent variables. 

Create a predictive model by applying some data science techniques for the price of cars with the available independent variables. That should help the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels

### Conclusion
-we tried predicting the car price using the various parameters that were provided in the data about the car. We build machine learning models like Linear regression,KNN,SVM to predict car prices and saw that machine learning-based model Linear Regression performed well at this data.


### Result 
r2scores of different models:
 - Linear regression = 0.83
 - KNN = 0.75
 - SVM regressor is not appropriate for this dataset
